# Oxford-challenge

This is a challenge sent to me by Oxford.

In designing the application, I made certain decisions to prioritize scalability and reusability, especially considering the possibility of the application having multiple pages.

By organizing the project into separate directories for components, styles, and utilities, I aimed to enhance modularity and maintainability. This structure allows for easy navigation and separation of concerns, making it simpler to locate and modify specific elements of the application.

Similarly, by implementing a centralized state management solution like Redux, I aimed to ensure consistent data flow and facilitate communication between components. This helps in managing complex application states and enables efficient sharing of data across different pages.

Additionally, utilizing a CSS-in-JS library like Tailwind allows for scoped styling and component-level theming. This approach promotes encapsulation and avoids style leakage between components, enhancing the maintainability and reusability of styles.

Overall, these decisions were driven by a desire to create a robust and extensible application architecture, enabling easy expansion and modification as the application grows in size and complexity.

Technologies: Typescript, React, Tailwind etc
